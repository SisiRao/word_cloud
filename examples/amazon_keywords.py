It's easy to apply and while you can tell it's there doing its job it doesn't feel heavy and greasy. Spray sunscreens also feel lighter than lotions, but it's impossible to direct the spray so it doesn't get all over, wasting product. With foam, you can make sure it goes right where you need it, not somewhere behind you on the ground. It's not unscented but the scent is light and doesn't linger.Well, it's been a challenge to find some sunshine and warm weather lately, but so far so good with this product. I have had some skin break outs from sunblock in the past, on shoulders and neck and face, but nothing from this. It's not at all sticky, and very easy to apply, with a spray that is easily controlled. The scent is not overpowering. I like it a lot.Unlike typical sunscreens that come as lotions that need to be rubbed into skin, this whipped sunscreen is easy to rub all over. This is a big deal, particularly when trying to apply sunscreen to kids. If you’ve ever wrestled with a 3-year-old when attempting to rub in a thick, pasty sunscreen, you will immediately understand the benefit of a whipped sunscreen. I also love that the SPF is 50. Sure, you still have to reapply regularly, particularly if swimming, but the 50 SPF means the sunscreen is about as strong of a block as it can be. The scent is pleasant and not to strong. Great product all around!Excellent sun screen, especially for quick trips when you don't want to drag a large tube with you. Unlike some liquid sunscreens, there's no mess on face or hands and I was able to quickly apply it in the car when I was rushing out the door. With SPF 50, a little goes a long way and I have a feeling these three little tubes will last for quiet a while.I love summertime, but the one part of my body that gets too much sun are my nose and lips. It’s good to have a product designed for the face and in a container that apply the sunscreen in a good fashion. I sometimes get a rash from products such as this, but this sunscreen stick does not give me a rash.Good sunscreen that isn't sticky! Does the job and feels nice.This sunscreen is not good for dark skin. Leaves a white cast on face. Will not purchase againThis comes out airy than a lotion, more mousse like. It blends into skin very easily and doesn't look or feel greasy. It's a great alternative to lotion and I like the feeling that I'm also adding moisture to my skin. I think it's priced a little high, but I will be looking for it in stores when I run out.Its like whipped cream. In an air pressurized can where you press the top button and it comes out like shaving cream. It lathers on very easy and does not feel as thick as in the normal bottle. This sunscreen has an SPF of 50 which is good for normal use, on days when the sun is not shining bright or comes through slats in the clouds where the intensity is unsuspectingly stronger than we realize. You get two canisters for the price of one in this purchase. They come shrink wrapped together and each bottle should last the summer for one person. Overall I am pleased with both the quality and delivery of the product. The aerated texture of the sunscreen feels nice and creamy and rubs into the skin softly. The only difference from this and the original bottles is the potential you will get less, either because of the pump or just wont pump all of it out of the can. Which is typical with this kind of delivery. The product itself is as you would expect from Coppertone.Very small, smaller than expected. But the small size also makes it convenient for tucking in bags and such for on the go. Goes on like a stick would. No strong odor.I'm hooked!

No strong odor.I was pleased that this Coppertone Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate Sunscreen Whipped Lotion did not irritate my often sensitive skin. It felt very creamy and moisturizing going on. The best way I can describe the way it feels is that it reminds me of rich shaving cream after I shake the can and push the button to release it. There is nothing oily or greasy about it at all. It does take a bit to rub it in to where it absorbs into the skin. It does seem to take more product to get coverage. The scent is pleasant. This lotion which claims up to 80 minutes of effectiveness in water, also claims broad spectrum protection classifying it as Hazmat which means that it is considered effective against a hazard, in this case ultraviolet radiation. There are many sunscreen and sunblock lotions with this level of protection. What sets it apart is that the lotion also enhances the quality of your skin with its Vitamin E and skin emollients. The five ounce size is reasonably easy to carry and is not overly bulky but is enough to get the job done.Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate, Whipped The “Whipped” version of this sunscreen is like shaving cream. I kind of like it. It’s easier to spread than lotion. It disappears after smoothing it in & is not greasy. You know you are wearing sunscreen but it’s not an oily/stinky mess. It has a light “Coppertone” scent. It did not irritate skin & does seem to work well – no sunburn here after applying it.Its sort of like chapstick for your face. The containers are small like an EOS, so they are easy to place in a purse or pocket. There is no scent and it does not go on greasy. It is very easy to apply and reapply over the course of sun exposure. My only issue is price. They are smal and the price is high, but the price is in line with other stick sunscreens on the market. Over all I do like how it works and goes on.These small compact Coppertone Defend & Care Face Sunscreen fit my wife's purse perfectly. She cares it with her for when we are on the go. She has used it on her arms as well. Coppertone Defend is an excellent product and we appreciate having this compact option. Well worth a full five stars!This is perfect for traveling! I love the packaging. And it works wonders. Even for me and my dark skin!I have never been disappointed by any Coppertone product and this is no exception!I’ve used other sunscreen sticks which worked OK but not great, so after that I figured sticks just didn’t work very well. However, this Coppertone stick actually works and is pretty useful. The sunscreen goes on, it doesn’t really need rubbing in (although I do a little, just to make sure I cover all area), it’s tiny and convenient to take with you skiing or hiking or whatever, and it seems like it will actually last a little while. Sometimes when using it I inadvertently twist and the stick goes back into storage. At first I thought it was being used up really fast!… but that’s not the case. The liquid is great, not too smelly, goes on smoothly and held up for a sunny spring ski day. Nice stuff.Very nice, silky texture, does not irritate my skin. Protection on a "regular" day of being inside and out was adequate.I am so pleased to have another choice of sunscreen for my face. I use Aveeno Protect for my face while at the beach and a more expensive brand on my nose under make-up. Coppertone Defend and Care, gives me another alternative. It is just for the face, has a Broad Spectrum SPF 50 and glides on easily. It fits easily into your purse, which is an added bonus. I sat outside yesterday, the first nice day in a very long while and applied this greaseless sunscreen stick....Easy to use, odorless, I liked the feel and texture and more importantly it worked. I am also grateful that Coppertone printed the expiration date on the bottom. I can't tell you how many lotions I was forced to throw out for that reason. A clever idea....sunscreen on the go.This truly does come out as a thick and luxurious mousse. Now, be sure to depress the button with care. The first time I tried to use this, I pressed too hard and too much came out. I was left with that "over-sunscreened, white and streaky" look as a result of my overzealous pressing. So, use a soft touch until you get used to exactly how hard to push for how much you need. Now, this formula applies with ease. And, most importantly there is no mess. In fact, I found this application method to be fast and more effective than any other method I have ever tried. Additionally, I was surprised at how the "sunscreen" smell is kept to an absolute minimum here. Very nice. When applied correctly (in an even, normal layer), this sunscreen leaves skin smooth and dry-to-the-touch. Unlike most all of my sunscreens, this one is not tacky. So, when I go jogging, dirt and pollen will not stick to my sunscreen. What a great change! (Especially since I have miserable allergies!) In my family, everyone complains about having to wear sunscreen: it's too time-consuming, it's sticky, it smells "funny," etc. Well, Coppertone leaves my family with no excuses. I genuinely appreciate that!Small sticks of sunscreen you can put in your purse, backpack, or beach bag or even your pocket. The sticks are less than 2". I am not sure how many applications are contained in each stick but It would not take too much to use up the stick in a couple of days at the beach. The stick is waxy but applies easily and does not leave you with a greased up feeling. The stick works much like stick deodorant or lipstick as you twist the bottom to raise it up for use. I feel as though it worked well and did not smear my make-up. The only con I see is that it is small but to be fair it does come in packs of three and fits nicely in my handbag.I find these 3 pounds tubes convenient to carry on my bike rides or while traveling. The sun screen goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and doesn't a feel oily. I also like the high SPF protection. I didn't like the 1.5 ounce stick. It's difficult to apply, especially on the face. It has the consistency of a glue stick, but much thicker. It actually pulls on your skin. I also find the price of almost $19 a bit steep. I like the cream in the tube, you did not like to stick.We have used Coppertone Sunscreen before with good results. The best thing about these are the size. They are small and easy to take with you. My wife likes them because she can have one in her purse for those times when needed but forgot to bring the larger container. The negative thing about these is also the size. They are small. They are not for the beach when you need a lot of sunscreen. They are for the face, and if just used for the face the small size will last a bit. Bottom Line: Very convenient small size to take along with you for those times you need to protect your face from the sun.I wish the cream (in the tubes) did not have such a strong scent. For something that I'm going to rub all over my face, it would be nice if it didn't smell so strongly of that trademark Coppertone scent. At least it rubs in clear without too much stickiness. The small stick is great for getting the really sensitive part under your eyes, and it doesn't smell at all, but it leaves a really sticky residue. It would be perfect for putting on babies, too, and other little people who don't like holding still and need a quick swipe to be protected. However, this is a lot of product for the price, and it protects great from sunburn.This set of Coppertone Defend & Care Oil Free Sunscreen Face Lotion + Stick SPF 50 Multipack is great for travel - the two tubes are TSA-size compliant and the short and round sunscreen stick is even more portable, great for storing in your bag for touch-ups as needed. All are SPF 50, powerful enough to protect a child's skin as well as an adult's (and given climate change, I think we need higher SPFs in general). The price is also great - less than $20 for all three. I've found it pays to stock up before you travel, as resorts charge outrageously high prices for these products if you get caught short.The small size makes this perfect to put in my pocket when I go out with my dogs. Application can be done hands free and the high SPF means it lasts a long time. I always have sunscreen with me and I love mess free products. Doesn't cause breakouts either.Great size to keep in your purse. It's like a tiny deodorant stick. Smaller than a travel size. The cap stays secure and the stick goes up and down by turning the bottom. The stick itself is on the hard but does go on pretty smooth. Very light fragrance and rubs in well. I recommend this if you are in the go.The Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate aerosol spray sunscreen is an excellent sunscreen by a well established sunscreen manufacturer (Coppertone), which is owned by the Bayer pharmaceutical giant. I always trust the big name companies when it comes to sunscreens, as they have a vested interest in maintaining a high standard of quality compared to off brand or generic pharmacy sunscreens. Pros and Cons - Pros: The spray is a superfine mist that moistens the skin and feels clean - after it dries, it feels like I have applied moisturizer but it is not greasy. The aerosol can is aluminum and has a twist-lockable (twist clockwise and there are two, audible clicks to let you know it's locked) top that won't spray out in your bag or be easily broken off in a jostling beach bag, backpack or car trunk. It's SPF 50, which is about all I can imagine needing as far as sun protection goes, and it's water resistant (80 minutes) - keep in mind that you'll always have to reapply any sunscreen throughout the day and never believe any sunscreen that says it is 'waterproof'. It's a broad-spectrum sunscreen, so it blocks both UVA and UVB. It also clearly has the expiration date stamped on the bottom of the can - many generic ones don't have this and it's a guessing game when you find a can from last season. Cons: It still smells a little like a sunscreen - sort of coconut, but that could be considered a pro for some people. It's a lot of protection, so if you're trying to tan this is probably not what you're looking for - again, could be a pro and is not a fault of the product. Finally, it is an aerosol, which should not be inhaled and perhaps could cause some issues for people who have sensitive lungs, but also it can be difficult to tell if you have missed a spot when applying - something you'll only know when you've been in the sun too long or after you have gone home. Personally, I really like this sunscreen and look forward to using it more on vacation soon.These are small lip balm sized Face Sunscreen. This Coppertone Defend & Care are prefect to throw in your purse or a pocket. They stay closed. They will melt if left in a hot car. They are very easy to use. If you are out with kids, or have no make up on they are super easy to rust wipe on cheeks and face and the tops of your ears. Also good for the back of your neck. Lasts for a maximum of 80 minutes! There is no smell, and they apply clear, but a little shine. Excellent when you don't want to stop your fun to go apply. I even used this on my lips and it protected them. Does not clog pores and I cleaned up with body wash.This Coppertone Defend & Care Oil Free Sunscreen Face Lotion + Stick SPF 50 Multipack is great for taking care of your skin when out in the sun. I like using Coppertone products in the summer. I have sensitive skin and my face especially will get discolored dark spots if I don't use sunblock so this is perfect for me. I love that this comes with the little stick as well so I can pop it in my purse for easy no mess re-applications.We really like the 50 SPF lotion and it being oil-free is a big plus! The face stick is perfect for travel. The lotion spreads easily and a small amount covers a generous area AND besides protecting against the sun, it also is soothing in the wind. Very glad to have two small containers instead of one large one. They fit easily in a pocket.Handy product to have. This is roll on sun screen in a case similar to lip balm but wider. Fits easily into a pocket or pocketbook. It has a slightly greasy feel when initially applied but is transparent. I found it easy to use and apply. I believe the sun protection is good but I usually reapply every 3-4 hours. Might not be my every day choice for facial sunscreen but a nice cost effective choiceThese containers are very small and with a twist of the rim the sunscreen spins up. Even though it's less then in inch long it is firm so it will go a long ways. I tested it when doing mowing the yard in the bright sun and it kept my face from getting red. I don't know how well it will stay a solid in the heat of summer but if I find out it liquifies I'll update this review. As of now it works great. Smells nice too. Goes on clear.Spray-on sunscreen is a nice, easy and quick way to apply sunscreen and can be done so without having to fiddle with bathing suit straps. It does feel particularly cold going on, but that's the nature of the beast. I like spray-on sunscreen. It's still early spring, so I can't vouch for how effective the performance of this particular product is, but I suspect it works as advertised. The one thing I noticed is that it does NOT smell like most other sunscreen out there. If you've ever worn sunscreen before, you know what I'm talking about. This doesn't smell *bad* per se, but it isn't pleasant, either. My wife says it smells like bug spray. ... ok, maybe, but it isn't strong. Having said that, I prefer the regular sunscreen smell better. The cap twists to lock the button to prevent accidental discharge while in a bag or in little kids' hands. The contoured bottle is easy to hold, even with wet hands.I have been very happy with Coppertone products in general. This level of protection is what I am seeking, too bad I didn't have something like this when I was much, much younger. It goes on fairly dry and doesn't seem greasy. I tried it the other day but I'm not sure snow glare protection counts. It seems to work just fine.It's always tricky having sunscreen on your face. The best sunscreens are the mineral based ones with Zinc Oxide or Titanium Oxide but those leave a layer of whiteness that doesn't go away and is visually unappealing; especially if you don't want people to know you've got sunscreen on. The other alternative are chemical sunscreens which get absorbed into the skin and could be endocrine disruptors. But this sunscreen, it's chemical based but the chemicals used are actually low toxicity. No Oxybenzone and no Octinoxate! (Which are the worst) All the sunscreens used have a toxicity level of 3 or in the case of Homosalate, a toxicity level of 4(according to EWG.) So that is excellent. I did notice that this sunscreen is a little on the pricey side but I think that's why - they managed to get rid of the whiteness without exposing you to the really harmful chemicals. In addition, it goes on smoothly without a greasy feel and gets absorbed quickly. . I have sensitive skin that often limits what skin products I use but I've had no reaction whatsoever to this. There is a slight, sun-screeny smell but it's very faint. So this is by far my favorite sunscreen. I've been very happy with this and have been wearing it daily.For now I'm just giving this product 4 stars because I don't know how it will do when it gets hot outside. Will it melt inside it's container and become runny? Will it leak inside my backpack? I don't know. I will be using it a lot this spring and summer when out on the tennis courts. It gets blazing hot sometimes down here in the Deep South, and I have to a lot use sunscreen. But so far, I like this sunscreen and have used it a couple of times already. It goes on easily enough and moisturizes my face pretty well. I will keep one in my purse and one in my tennis bag.I use this brand and try their products because they continue to improve. This one to me is an improvement in several ways. One is that it is oil free and unlike some sun care products that can do more to harm than protect you this one has ingredients to soften and moisten the skin as well as protect it. Once applied your skin looks natural and you can have no concern about walking directly into a restaurant or go shopping without looking all oiled up. And the slight fragrance is tuned in to be complimentary to every family member. It leaves a subtle sheen that remains after several minutes but it’s not really noticeable and in fact looks healthy. I tried washing it off with soap and hot water and it took a little scrubbing to feel like I removed it all. This product page lists 6 different products in 12 different sizes, the one I’m commenting on is shown in my snapshot of the bottle.This is the latest edition of the Coppertone brand SPF face lotion. Package offers two large bottles of the face lotion and one small stick. Products have SPF50. I like the fact that product does not leave a white film on the skin once it is applied. Small stick can be easily placed in a purse. It is important to apply the lotion at least 30 minutes before heading out in the sun. If one is exercising, sweating or swimming, the lotion needs to be reapplied immediately after the activity. Otherwise, lotion should be reapplied every couple of hours if one is outdoors or in a sun. I love Coppertone scent, so I am please to have this new edition of Coppertone products in a supply for the new season.I've never tried a whipped sunscreen lotion before. It's an interesting concept, and one we've been lacking. The sprays are just plain awful. There. I said it. Sprays go everywhere and just make a mess. You're lucky if you get any on you at all if there's any sort of breeze. For these reasons and more, I've just stuck to lotions. Then along comes this whipped version (like a mousse) that goes on lighter than lotion and seems to absorb quicker onto my skin. The only downside is that it seems a bit more pricey than similar lotions. Also, I'm not sure about traveling with it on a plane; I'd be afraid that it would accidentally start releasing in my suitcase since there's no cap on it.If you have to work outside all day and want something with zinc oxide to cover the nose and other vital facial parts, this is a good bet. It's not like the regular SPF 50 sunscreens one uses for the rest of the body. There are other brands with zinc oxide sunscreens for the face, but most are spendy as if they're rare cosmetics. With this Coppertone clear zinc facial sunscreen, one gets 3 ounces and so won't have to reorder for awhile.Love using this, no mess, only it does stain some clothes, but I guess they all do.This review is for the Coppertone Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 (5-Ounce) Goes on like whip cream, then you rub it in. No yucky smell like you are a coconut farm. Does not clog pores, so you won't look like you have small pox after a couple of days of continuous use.Normally I'm not a fan of the aerosol style sunscreen's, but this one is different. My main issue with them is the insane (and IMO rude) over-spray they tend to exhibit, and overpowering smell. This has a much lighter and less powerful spray, keeping it far more controlled and contained (You still need to rub it in like all the others though). The smell is noticeably similar to isopropyl alcohol initially (you do need to get close), though doesn't linger, smells sort of lemony after. It also does not feel greasy after applying. I have no way to empirically verify it's effectiveness or claims of water resistance (80 min), though being a Coppertone product and not some fly by night generic I'd feel safe that it will perform as advertised. This is absolutely getting added to our kids summertime arsenal.This sunscreen is just what my family needs. The small size stick is perfect for a backpack, purse and even a golf bag. My kids won't mind taking this a long since it's small. It has a 50 SPF, water resistant and antioxidant enriched--which I guess that last part is a good thing. Nothing great about the scent because it smells like sunscreen. Recommended for convenience and the SPF especially.Coppertone Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 comes in a spray can. The zinc-based formula smells nice and goes on clear. It dries quickly and doesn't leave any greasy residue. I prefer spay-on sunscreen because it is easier to apply. This sunscreen is water-resistant for 80 minutes and has moisturizers. I like this product from Bayer Healthcare more than my other sunscreens.Took these products to the beach for Spring Break. 1. Not Greasy, absorbs easily. 2. WORKS! but I re-applied after 1 hr in the water. 3. Smells good, not strong. 4. Does not clog pores. Love this!Spread some of this in your fingers to soften and apply to the face. Works well and does prevent sunburn.My new favorite suntan lotion. It does spray out like hair mouse a bit, but it's very easy to apply and feels very light. It is a bit hard to control the spray, so it's best to choose a random spot away from your eyes and then spray. Just spread and lather it around with your hands. Works great, especially on my kids.I wish I had this stuff 10 years ago. Seriously. Skiing or hiking for a day, my face constantly gets sunburned. Traditional lotion tends to run when I sweat, itches and is messy. This is like a big lip-balm. Rubs on with wax-like stick, then spread around with a couple of fingers. Works extremely well, almost scentless. Easy to toss in a bag, pack or pocket.I appreciate sunscreen with a high SPF and pleasant fragrance, which means I don't want to smell like a pina colada. This product is good on both counts. 50 SPF. It feels watery, but is branded as hydrating. Water- and sweat-resistant for 80 minutes. Spray can, so not messy.This is one of the highest protection one can expect in a sunscreen, and while it’s zinc oxide based, it does go transparent after application. It also leaves a smooth feeling in the skin, not a sticky sensation like others sunscreens. I like the this spray more than the lotion, and the fact that this is good for the entire family, even for my baby. I just put it in my left palm and pick some to apply in my child’s face and small body. The only thing I need to remember is to reapply it after a couple of ours, or if we get into the water at the beach.I've always viewed Coppertone as a good solid brand in the sunscreen / SPF arena. I view this Ultra "whipped" as a more premium product from Coppertone. Besides using on myself we have two kids and we try to be good about having them wear a good SFP when they are out and about (as opposed to the 1970's when I grew up...play all day with no sunscreen until your top layer of skin just peels off...then play some more). What we like: ++ 50 SPF is a good protection level. Also water resistant (they quote up to 80 minutes) is a great feature to have with kids. ++ The "whipped" is great and makes wearing the lotion more comfortable...consistency of a mousse and thus goes on easily and feels light. No scent that I can detect which is also a desirable quality. ++ Easy on the skin. The zinc-based does seem to cause less skin irritation. I've had some goopy sunscreens that have irritated my skin but no issues with this Coppertone whipped. -- Any cons: no gripes from me so far. At current price of $24 for 5 ounces (about $5 per ounce) this is a more pricey offering for Coppertone but still less expensive than some premium perceived brands. In summary, a great sunscreen offering from Coppertone. A bit pricier than some of their other offerings but the whipped feature is worth a premium given that it is easy to apply and doesn't irritate the skin (and still less expensive per ounce than some other sunscreens we use). My rating is 5-STARS in consideration of price/value.The Coppertone Defend & Care Sunscreen Stick SPF 50 is ideal for those on the go moments when you honestly didn't plan to be in the sun for an extended amount of time. The small size is ideal for throwing into a purse but it's a little bulky for something like a side pocket on a pair of pants for instance. If wearing a fanny pack type bag this would fit with no issue whatsoever. I like that this goes on clear. I don't have to press hard into my sensitive skin to apply. It doesn't smear or leave any sort of residue behind on my nose, ears, and the rest of my face. My face feels just as natural as before I put it on. I am pleased there's no heaviness in association with the use of this sunscreen stick. The scent is quite light and doesn't linger long after applied. I am usually quite sensitives to smells so I am quite pleased it did not bother me. I've been out in sun for many hours after applying and my skin has not burned. I've yet to try it in the water but note that it is to be applied every 80 minutes if I am getting wet swimming or something. Zero breakouts have occurred on my face following use of this product. I am happy about this fact because I have normally oily skin and adding more oil to it usually doesn't reap the best results. Speaking of oily, my skin doesn't seem to look greasy or overly shiny when using this. I appreciate there's an expiration date on the bottom so I know when I should stop using the product. I do feel with the amount I'll very easily use this product before it runs out, especially if I share it with my three children for those on the go times we don't plan on being in the sun. One thing that I don't like is the cap. The cap doesn't quite lock or stay shut as tightly as I would wish it too. A child could so easily get ahold of this and without an effort get it open. I keep this stored in my purse in a protective bag so if the lid does come off, it wouldn't get on the inside purse or ruin anything else inside. While not advertised with a child cap I can look past that but I am not a fan of how weak the lid is in keeping it closed. The price is okay. I feel a $3-5.00 price cut would be better in always keeping my bag stocked with this, especially during the Summer months when we are outside a lot. Aside from the cap issue, I'm happy with how well this product works and recommend it.I was getting what I thought was small bites from something in the ocean. Turns out I was getting an itchy rash from different sunscreens with ingredients like oxybenzone. NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ZINC BASED PRODUCT. I was even able to thin it about 10% with water and still works well while leaving only a slight white haze. I'll take that any day over the awful itching from the other products. It protects as well as any other sunscreen I've tried, even thinned down a little. An added plus is that it seems to help prevent mosquito bites. Been in the Florida Keys now for 8 weeks and only 5 bites, even though I've spent a lot of time outside in the late afternoon/early evening and haven't always used another repellent.This Coppertone sunscreen lotion works great. I can relax in the sun knowing that my family and I are safe. It is also water resistant so we can enjoy the swimming pool or the beach safely. You just apply the SPF 50 lotion and you're safe for 80 minutes. The sunscreen is mineral-based and contains no harmful ingredients. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to spend quality time in the sun safely.This went on cleanly, had a nice scent, didn't leave a white streak anywhere, and fully protected against hot California sun. The kids didn't mind having it on and I appreciated that my skin didn't dry out.I will say that for an SPF 50 sunscreen, this is _relatively_ clear, but it's not actually clear as advertised. I can rub it in for a while and still have some white residue on my skin. Not horrible, but not what I expected from the description. I first tried Coppertone's SPF 50 baby version because I wanted something for my sensitive skin, but that stuff is utterly white and hard to rub in. This is much, much better. Not totally clear, no, but much better. I've just decided to apply it, rub it in, and then wipe the white residue off with a paper towel. Like their baby version, this hasn't caused any irritation at all to my sensitive skin. Awesome. I also like that the scent if fairly mild. It smells like sunscreen, but the odor is pretty faint. I've never loved the smell of suntan lotion, so I like that the scent is mild. It sure seems to work well, too. I've been wearing SPF 15 lotion for a while now (which absorbs really easily without any white residue), but I do think that this does work better just like it should. I think it's a good sunscreen, but just don't expect it to be totally clear.Goes on super smooth, like whipped cream. Blends into skin easily and seems to last pretty well. I wouldn't use it if you are going to be very active and sweating a lot. You'd probably have to reapply a lot more often. The price is the drawback. Currently at $22.89 for a 5 ounce can, that is incredibly pricey.This is a cute little twist stick of sunscreen. It's very small so very easy to stash in a purse when you are on the go. Protection-wise, I haven't had an issue. I live in a tropical country with a strong sun and wearing it on my face has kept me sunburn free. The stick is meant for your face--it says it doesn't clog pores (which can definitely be an issue with sunscreen.) It certainly is not big enough to use on larger body area. The product says it glides on easy and blends well. I don't think it goes on that well. It's a little sticky (though not as bad as the Coppertone Sport Stick. That was like putting a glue stick on.) It blends fine, but it doesn't glide on like deodorant or anything. Overall, it's effective. I like it in a pinch (like if I'm out in the sun for a long time and I need to reapply), but I prefer to use a cream in general.A zinc sunscreen with no white cast that goes on clear?! Found it! Depending on what we are doing for the day I will grab some spray on sunscreen or traditional lotion type sunscreen. This is the best zinc lotion type sunscreen I have used hands down. Goes on smoothly and easily, no white cast, minimal "grease" feelingWe've had some warm days lately so I've been able to try more sunscreen than my usual with foundation. This Coppertone Hydrate mousse works really, really well. I like the mousse part of it because it's so easy to apply, you can see how much you're putting on without it being too greasy or runny, it smells likes coconuts without being too overpowering, and it does help to give your skin a bit of moisture. It absorbs well without leaving you with a bunch of white streaks, too, so it works on the face as well as the rest of the body. It did a good job of protecting my skin (which is on the pale side and easy to burn) for the couple of hours we were out in the sun. All in all, I much prefer this over the sprays since it is easy to apply and it doesn't go all over the place.This is my new favorite when it comes to sunscreens for my face. I am relatively fair (Irish bloodlines) and also 60 something. I worry about things like cancer more and more these days (along with the impact that excess sun has on aging skin. Along with trying to eat right, exercising and doing spa treatments occasionally (microderms, facials), my skin looks terrific. And I know that, for my age, I look younger than many of my younger (in age) neighbors here in Florida. Sun damage wreaks havoc on your skin and this Coppertone Defend and Care works great. SPF 50, I apply it under my makeup each morning and I am good all day at the office. I particularly like this brand of sunscreen as it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly so it doesn't mess with my makeup. Nothing but great things to say about this, every home should have at least one of these on hand at all times.Not sure if I love or hate this sunscreen. The whipped portion means it comes out as an aerosol, but it's not a spray (giving you a silly string like spray that doesn't go very far). The first time I used it, I sprayed it and it went right on the floor, whoops. It does go on really nice, and it's not greasy like non-whipped sunscreen, so that's quite nice.I ride my bike a lot and often need to keep sunblock in my car. This hasn’t melted as easily as others and it’s very easy use without getting all over the place. I like the Chapstick style container and the stick style which makes it easy to put on especially the face. The container also could be compared to deodorant where you turn it and it moves up as you use more and more of it. I find this to be really easy to use and a great way to put it on before sports. It Does not have a strong scent but does not bother you either which is a great place for me because I’m allergic to so many things.Great sunscreen, SPF50 with zinc, great combo. The lotion has a slight greasy feel to it but not sticky, the lotion comes white but blends in clear fairly easily. We are ready for the pool with this one, great product!This small size is great to toss in your purse so that you always have sunscreen on hand for your face. Hyperpigmentation has taught me to never go without sunscreen and I go through it like crazy. It is not sunny enough yet to really test how well it will do for me, but I will definitely be back to update that info once the warmer months come around. I am a huge "use sunscreen!!" person ever since my hyperpigmentation developed. Wish I knew when I was younger. It ttpically takes several years for those conditions to develop, so please think ahead and especially for your kids.. 10 years from now they will thank you for using sunscreen when they don't pop up one day randomly with brown splotches all over their face from sun exposure. My daughters love to tan but they know they have to use sunscreen. They see what I go through, how pretty much no sunscreen at all keeps the marks from getting darker. A short car ride in the summer and I can literally feel my face darkening, I can feel the spots tingling. Not fun. Not attractive. I have used this one mainly to get an idea of how it feels on my face since it is not sunny yet. It glides on nicely which is a nice change in a stick form. Sometimes they're hard to apply, like they want to just drag across the skin and pull it. This one feels more like a nice lip balm going on and doesn't make my face feel too greasy or gunky and doesn't make the tiny pimples come up like a lot of sunscreens do. Curious how it will perform in the summer. As I said, I will be back to update that.First off, no chemical smell that comes with most suncreens! It does have a scent but not that overwhelming "sunscreen" scent that I really hate. Second, this is a mousse, just like what you apply to your hair. After unlocking the cap (twist!) and spraying a little bit into my hand, it smoothed perfectly into my skin and dried quickly. I applied this right before a day of gardening and it was a warm, sunny day. The sunscreen stayed in place and didn't come off after a bit of sweat. After almost four hours of sun and I didn't end up burnt to a crisp like I normally do! WIN! I have dry, sensitive skin and this caused no irritation.I really like this Coppertone Defend and Care Whipped Sunscreen. It reminds me of hair mousse as far as the way it sprays out of the can and “grows” in your hand. A small amount goes a long way, and I see no white residue on my skin. I have fair skin, but find that it absorbs well and feels light and non greasy.As far as I can tell, this seems to be free of methylparaben. This works great!I really like the coverage that this gives. I have very sensitive pale skin, so I use sunscreen year round. I like this because there is really no heavy smell and it goes on easy and clear. It also nicely moisturizes your skin. This is gonna be my new go to.This is a decent sunscreen in a VERY overpriced tiny container. I was surprised when it came how small the container is, and of course some of the container is empty. I also don't care for the shape of the container. A round stick with a domed lid is awkward in a pocket. I prefer a flat rectangular stick. 4 star sunscreen that loses a star for packaging.My house has the Coppertone Defend & Care Sunscreen stick and lotion. We live in California and are always outside. My kids play a number of different sports throughout the year. When they are not playing sports we are backpacking/camping or swimming or at the beach. This Coppertone stuff works great and really suits our active lifestyle. The sunscreen goes on and stays on quite well through sweat and even come water. Both products go on smooth and without residue. There is some lotion inside to help dry skin. This is great for those that can get dry skin especially if you are swimming in chlorinated water. Besides the sunblock what I like the most is the lack of scent of these products. Both the stick and lotion go on and have almost no smell. Certainly not noticeable after a few minutes. The only negative I have is that the stick is super small. I would like to see a jumbo size stick made available that can last the summer.Safe ingredients which is the most important aspect to sunscreens. Coppertone has a wide variety of sunscreen products that range from safe to not at all safe but this one would rank as safe to use. It is easy to apply, smells nice and seems to work very well. However, I do not understand the price, this Coppertone Defend & Care Ultra Hydrate Sunscreen is one of the most expensive sunscreens I have ever seen. Searching the net revealed similar pricing and some lower pricing but no prices that seemed reasonable. There are lots of sunscreens available that are safe and effective and lot less expensive.This is great Sunscreen. I love the whipped as it spreads easily and didn't feel greasy. It def leaves you a little bit white if you doing rub it in well.I had to use a lot of the product to get adequate coverage. I applied it and was in the hot Florida sun for over an hour and my skin was protected. I have used other Coppertone products that I have liked better than this one. I don't think it will last long if I have to use so much of it each time.Love this product. Unlike other sunscreen lotions, it literally takes a couple of seconds and wipes to apply this lotion without any white residues. This lotion doubles as sunscreen and moisturizer. It goes without saying that because of the price tag, limit use to facial area only. I use it when I'm playing tennis under the sun.Finally someone has figured out how to produce sunscreen that does not make you fragrant as a breach bum. While this is a great sunscreen for a day out in the sun, it has that added bonus of being useful daily. I applied it to my face before makeup and it went on smoothly without a white mask. I also used it on the backs of my hands where I already had a cancer spot and it protected them nicely in the Florida sun. This is 5 stars just for not having the sunscreen smell.I like this it's like whipped lotion, easy to apply, water proof and not a sticky runny mess. It does leave you feeling hydrated and more importantly protects your skin from sun damage. I'm not sure why it over $40.00 but a little goes a long way so it should last a long time.Living in California certainly has its perks, and fantastically sunny weather is definitely one of them. With the temperatures around 80 degrees in February, our family has been getting out and about on more impromptu outdoorsy trips and enjoying the sun. Coppertone Defend and Care Facial Sunscreen worked really well at keeping our faces protected from burns. The sunscreen is similar in size and shape of an EOS Visibly Soft Lip Balm Sphere, Vanilla Mint, 0.25 Ounce , and goes on similar to a chapstick. The sunscreen goes on smoothly and it does work effectively at protecting faces from getting burned. It doesn't feel heavy or cakey, however does feel like something is on your face and it leaves a noticeable sheen when applied - it essentially feels like there's chapstick on your face. The sunscreen has little to no scent to it, and it doesn't irritate my skin. This sunscreen is a fantastic item to have on hand, particularly if you have young kids - you can simply swipe some sunscreen on their faces, and they can be off without much fuss. While this is a good "carry and take on the go" option for sunscreen, I have to emphasize that this is a very VERY tiny amount of sunscreen to have on hand. This is a pricey sunscreen, and I'm not sure I would buy it in the future simply because it's convenient - with two very active kids, this wouldn't last all too long in our house. I am more inclined to stick get the Coppertone SPORT Sunscreen Stick Broad Spectrum SPF 50, 1.5-Ounce which is four times the size, and much more cost effective. Overall, this is a good product, but not a particularly good value.This Coppertone sunscreen is fantastic in that it applies easily and doesn’t have a greasy feel. I play a lot of golf and wear a lot of sunscreen. I had no issues with sunburn or anything after using this during my last few rounds. Overall a great product!This Coppertone Sunscreen (SPF 50) for the face comes in a small applicator. It resembles a very large lip balm stick. To use it, you roll it up and apply to your face, rolling it down when finished. It can be easily carried in a purse or beach bag. The only thing I don't like about it is that instead of spreading smoothly, little pieces break off and I have to spread them over my face until they blend into the rest of it. It can be worn with/without makeup. If you sweat, it should be reapplied about every 90 minutes.I really like the Coppertone Defend and Care Whipped Ultra Hydrate SPF 30. It’s not your typical spray on sun screen. It comes out of the can like whipped mousse, it is easy to apply, smells like coconuts, and works! The first thing that really surprised me was just how whipped and creamy it was coming straight from the can. It was literally like whipped cream! Although it is whipped, it isn’t too thick or runny either. It’s like this perfect blend that rubs in so well and leaves no streaks or bare spots. As mentioned above, it’s easy to apply. While it’s not as easy as the aerosol for those hard to reach spots on your back, it’s easy to apply and greaseless. You aren’t going to have to worry about permanently mucking up your glasses or your phone screen if you touch them after applying this sunscreen and that is great! The sunscreen has a very pleasant tropical kind of coconut smell. It’s not overpowering and it doesn’t give me a migraine like a lot of sunscreen fragrances do. So now for the important part...it works! Not only does it apply well, and smell great which is all fine and dandy, but it works well and is water resistant up to 80 minutes. I was unable to test the water resistance since it happens to be winter time, but we have had quite a few 60+ degree days lately and I put it on before going out for our walks and didn’t have any burning or reddening afterwards. Keep in mind, I am a person who easily burns and am ghostly white in color. I have to wear sunscreen year round. It worked fabulously! Overall, I think this is an awesome sunscreen and I will definitely be buying this again in the future! Totally recommend this one! Great product!!!!Great texture and rubs into skin well. Since it is winter, I have been using it under my makeup as a sunscreen and moisturizer lotion. It is great as a sunscreen - but did streak my makeup a little bit and made my nose and forehead shiny by end of day. I think this is probably better as just a sunscreen in summer for the beach and long days outside. I really liked that it rubbed into skin to be totally clear. It was gentle and not irritating at all to my oily/combo skin.I work outside in Texas year round with horses and sunscreen is a daily must. It's non negotiable and I have just learned to accept the funky white lotion look on my nose. This is pretty much clear as they claim. I'm very happy about that actually. So far I haven't experienced any skin break outs or irritation with this sunscreen - nor have I had any sunburn. I'm using this on my face and neck when working at the farm and I scrub my face clean as soon as I get home.This is a review of the STICK. For when you want a sunscreen which is more like a lip balm in texture -- goes on smooth, small container -- ideal for noses, foreheads, cheeks. This is not really suitable for your whole body, it's ideal for touching up small parts of your skin.February isn't the greatest time of year to test sunscreen, even in South Texas. I can't really tell how well it will protect my face from sunburn, but the whipped formula does go on easily. It's transparent, so no white "face paint," and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I also like the locking cap, which should prevent mishaps in my beach bag. I took one star off due to the price -- it's way more expensive than the sunscreen I normally use. That's why I would only use it on my face so it will last longer.Literally like shaving cream or whipped cream. Works into your skin beautifully, no white gunk left, just a nice, slight sheen. If you'd like a 50spf sunscreen that works into your skin fast without a lot of work then this will be great for you. It does spray from the can pretty fast so easy to overload if using on a small area. The very faintest of a Coppertone scent. Hardly even noticeable but it's there. Sorry I am a fan of the full bore Coppertone scent of years ago and instant summer memories when used no matter what season it was. This is a very innovative idea to get your little ones to wear it! It's fast and fun!!I like any sunscreen, truthfully. The higher the SPF, the better. But I'm not sure why I'd buy this over another one. The "whipped" marketing ploy usually means you're paying for air. This sunscreen does go on smoothly and feels light on the skin. I appreciate that they tell you on the bottle how often to apply the sunscreen (80 minutes, even in water). But, frankly, I'm not going to watch the clock when I'm outside, so I generally go for a higher SPF. I do like the locking top -- I can't tell you how many times sunscreen has gotten all over my beach bag and ruined books, clothing and food because the lid wasn't closed tightly enough.Skiing in Utah at just over 8000' on a brilliantly clear day - the perfect time to test out a new sunscreen. The first difficulty we encountered was the product design. The product looks as though it's a pump spray where you push down with the force necessary to generate a desired amount of product. Nope. This is an aerosol and what matters is the duration for which you push down. So of course my first time, I ended up with a palm full of sunscreen. But even to get there first required that I look closely at the cap to understand how it works. It arrived in the locked position and the top part of the cap has to be rotated to get to the unlocked position; you don't need to remove the strip around the base of the cap - that's there to allow the locking process to work in the first place. Well, anyway, once I had my handful of sunscreen, I applied it rather thickly to my face, which was then in the sun for most of the day from 9am to 4pm. Now the can says I should reapply the sunscreen every 2 hours, but I wasn't about to carry a big aerosol can with me all day so I ignored that recommendation. Happily, the sunscreen worked quite well and there's no indication at the end of the day that I was ever out in the sun. My skin feels nicely moisturized, an unlikely experience after a day in the dry mountain air, and there's no chemical scent or any rash or redness from the product itself. My 14 year old son tried it as well (given that I had that full palm of sunscreen to begin with), and he had the same experience. So the product works perfectly and, while somewhat expensive, does a superb job of keeping your skin safe. The delivery process is less than desirable only because the cap design is non-intuitive and the size of the can is more than is necessary for a mere 5 ounces of product, making it a bit less travel-friendly than it could be otherwise.I'm a fan of super light sunscreens since I tend to sweat easily with any type of occlusive product. This new formula from Coppertone is great, I don't feel like I'm wearing sunscreen at all. In fact, I will be replacing my much beloved No Ad spray sunscreen with this one because it's much better (I don't need to reapply as often) and I appreciate not getting sunscreen everywhere, the spray tends to be a bit uncontrollable, especially when it clogs up a bit. I love the locking cap, this keeps it from getting on anything in my bag. The fragrance is nice, barely there...I don't notice it after about 20 min. The texture is like whipped cream, very light and airy. I tend to squirt out too much until I get used to this type of sunscreen, I guess I'll be wasting a bit. I love that this is water resistant, it doesn't wash off as easily as the No Ad I was using before. So far this sunscreen is doing a good job of keeping me from burning, we're having Summer in February, so I'm happy to be fully protected, even though it's technically "Winter".I found this product to be great for a first application in the morning, supplemented with a spray on sunscreen for renewed protection later in the day. This does go one quite clear, so the marketing of 'invisible' is more or less accurate. I switched from an Aveeno sunscreen that is much thicker and whiter and though the Coppertone is more runny and doesn't leave a white residue, its performance is just as good. I was impressed with the way my skin felt, with moisturized skin, which feels more comfortable when I'm working outdoors. This effect was helpful because in a few hours I no longer felt moisturized, and instead just felt sweaty, and that was a good indication that it was time to apply more. I suppose to some, the fact that you can feel an oily residue is a negative, but it's really a plus. Anything that was completely unnoticeable would also be ineffective. This kind of sunscreen, the white lotion, is best for a first application because you can clearly see it and make sure you got the neck, the ears, every spot on your arms, and just rub it until it's absorbed. This takes time so I only do this first thing, and then every few hours I spray some aerosol version sunscreen on. If I do this, and stay hydrated, I will be fine under a blaring Texas sun.Here's the thing. This is good sunscreen, but it's just sooo expensive. As of this writing, a bottle of this is 5 ounces and costs over 3x as much as a 7 oz bottle of Coppertone Sport. So it's basically 4x as expensive. Is this sunscreen nicer? Probably. It comes out very foamy and feels like shaving cream. It's pleasant, with a nice texture, but once you start rubbing it in, it obviously condenses and so the density and feel end up being fairly similar to Coppertone sport in my opinion. It's a little lighter and a little less oily feeling, so if you have really really sensitive skin or really hate lotions, then maybe you can justify the price difference. But for me, Coppertone Sport is the much better purchase. That said, I grew up in San Diego going to the beach every day, so I'm very used to wearing sunscreen.Coppertone is a name I know and can trust when it comes to sunscreen. This is no different. I like the coverage of zinc, yet the fact it’s colorless and absorbs into the skin. I feel comfortable that lotion, as opposed to spray, actually gets on my skin. I am also comfortable leaving it on for the time prescribed without re-application. The lotion is light and feels light when rubbing it in. It does not leave a greasy residue on your hands. All in all, great product!This stuff looks like mousse when it comes out, but it turns out to be surprisingly thick and somewhat tacky until I smooth it on. That takes some rubbing. Once it's on, I don't notice it (unlike some other sunscreens I can't ignore). I used it over the weekend while doing the gardening and it did its job.Since this is a special face formula the 50 SPF is a welcome intensity however it’s white out of the tube and takes some rubbing to make the whiteness disappear. I suppose they haven’t exactly told a falsehood in advertising this as clear but they do make you work to achieve that. On the plus side there’s an extemely light scent that all but goes away within minutes of applying it. The small, lightweight bottle makes it easy to tuck into a purse or gym bag.This Defend & Care, Clear Zinc Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Lotion from Coppertone is a new twist on an old, reliable sunscreen - zinc oxide. Remember the old, whit, zinc oxide sunscreen of your youth? When everyone had a white nose? This is a new formulation of zinc oxide which makes it almost clear. When rubbed in, it just slightly whitens your skin but not enough to be glaring. It's also completely non-greasy, which my entire family prefers. It has an SPF of 50, which is plenty for everyone but the most sunburn prone people and it lasts up to 80 minutes - even in water. It provides broad spectrum protection from UVA and UVB rays. Since zinc oxide is a physical barrier sunscreen rather than a chemical sunscreen, it's a better choice for sensitive skin and is why most baby sunscreens are the physical barrier type. It comes in a 6oz tube with a flip top cap. It's more of a thick lotion and it rubs in easily. It has a very faint, pleasant scent. Most people don't apply enough sunscreen so be generous when applying. Also, every sunscreen works best when applied 15 minutes before sun exposure so it has a chance to absorb. Finally, remember to reapply at least every 2 hours - more often if you are sweating a lot or in water. No sunscreen lasts the entire day with just one application. This is a great, non-greasy sunscreen with excellent protection from sun damage and I like it a lot.We use sun block when in extended times in the sun. We enjoy the outdoors and commonsense protectors like sunglasses and hats. This is product works well and protects well. It has a nice light smell- makes me think of the outdoors and smoothly applies. It's rated SPF 50 and states 80 minutes of water resistance. What else could you ask for? Well, there's some debate on the safety of sun care products- nothing's easy or simple. This one use very effective zinc oxide and octinoxate and another Octi product. I see these in most sun lotions. My advice- if you're worried about the chemicals, don't use- go natural and use commonsense. We do that most of the time. I mean it's good to be out in the sun to a degree. Otherwise, use them when needed to protect vulnerable areas: nose, ears, fair skin/sensitive etc. Keep an eye on changes in the literature.My past experience with Zinc is back when it was thick and difficult to remove after spending time in the sun. This is such a great improvement compared to what I used to use. This lotion goes on smooth and washes off easily with soap and water. Coppertone does it again with providing a great option for allowing fun in the sun without the negative effects of the sun rays. Easy to use bottle and just the right size to carry in a bag or the car.Seems to work well, I am outside teaching tennis every day for at least 3-5 hours and it stayed with me for the entire time. Minus one star for the consistency doesn't go on as smoothly as Equate. It goes on very white, not as invisible as Equate. Would like to see Consumers Report test it.Note: Amazon groups several different versions of Coppertone all together. I like this a lot. It isn't exactly clear, but doesn't leave any white residue. However, besides zinc which is a physical sunscreen, it contains 2 chemical sunscreens. It dries fast, and makes my skin feel soft and not sticky or greasy. My reason for 4 stars, not 5 stars, is I don't LOVE any sunscreen! It's one of my favorites of all I've used, but not lovable.This COPPERTONE DEFEND & CARE CLEAR ZINC SUNSCREEN (Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Lotion, 6 Fluid Ounces) lives up to its advertising claims. It comes out of the bottle as a white lotion, but it dries clear (as long as you wipe off any really thick excess). Most importantly for me, it doesn’t feel like you have a thick, greasy coating of something on your face after you apply it. Far from feeling greasy, it makes the skin on your face feel soft. Also, the sunscreen doesn’t run into your eyes (as you perspire normally) after it’s been on your face for a few hours. As I understand it, the latest research says you don’t need a really high SPF number (over 100, say) to get reasonable sun protection. Whatever the current received wisdom is about SPFs, this keeps my fair skin from burning when I’m outdoors for 30-45 minutes at the local farmer’s market.arrived just in time for our annual Key West trip - and it was awesome. Clean and not messy, offering outstanding protection.It's fine and it works well, but I'm a little weirded out by the stick. I thought it would be less mess than a lotion, but I'm less sure that I've covered my skin. It's better for spot coverage than the whole face too. One thing I didn't think about before I got it is that it's also not for sharing. I take the youth in my church hiking regularly and they forget suntan lotion everytime. I wouldn't want to share this since you rub it on your skin. So it works, it's probably great for spot coverage, but it's not for me.Rubs easily into the skin. Does not leave that unattractive white residue. Offers complete protection from the sun. After one week at the beaches of Florida, not a single member of our family had a sunburn. And everyone looked great in photographs.Coppertone typically does what it says it's going to do. This one is 50 SPF, designed specifically to be used on the face. It contains antioxidants and supposedly does not clog pores. I like the design of the container. It's small enough to pack or carry easily. It needs to be applied after 80 minutes of sweating or swimming. This is a good product to protect yourself against the risk of skin cancer.With 3 grandchildren that play sports and spend lots of time outdoors, we are always looking for the best protection for their skin. This is easy to apply and does not have to be reapplied as often.I like this Coppeton Defend & Care. I was using another brand for sensitive skin (really, it was for babies) that had zinc oxide in it and it was very thick and white; however I didn’t mind because it wasn’t oily and didn’t irritate my skin. This Coppertone goes on not as thick and I don’t have to spend as much time massaging it in so my face doesn’t look so pale or have white streaks so that’s a nice plus for me. One of the markers of whether a sunscreen—particularly for the face—works for me is: Do I forget I have it on as I workout or go about my business? And with this Coppertone, I did completely forget I had it on! I have sensitive skin and Defend & Care didn’t irritate it, make it feel itchy, or redden my skin. But equally important for me, it was not oily—my hair didn’t stick to my face and create an oil slick to my hair. It really felt as if I wore nothing at all. I moisturize my skin before I put on this face sunscreen—at the least a serum—since it’s not emollient. I could put makeup over this Defend & Care as well and it would do fine. I’m pleased with it and have added it to my skincare regime.Great mineral sunblock that goes on smoothly and blends in well. Leaves a slight white sheen but not very noticeable. No noticible scent and didn’t irritate skin. Didn’t get burned while using itThis is great sunscreen. It is thick, but rubs in smoothly and doesn't have a harsh smell. It offers great coverage. It works well and I like it.I liked this lotion. It wasn't too thick like other zinc lotions I've used. I love that it provides sun protection because I must have it for medical reasons and that it does so without a bunch of fragrance that I can't tolerate on my face. I have extremely sensitive skin and this did not irritate it at all. Thankfully I had no reaction whatsoever which is common for me. I'm looking forward to using this throughout spring and summer. I've not been in much sun with it yet but will adjust accordingly after more use in heavier sun. Very happy with it so far.Finally a face stick small enough to carry in your pocket. This is about the size of an EOS ball, palm size if you're not familiar. The only difference is inside it's a stick, not a ball. SPF 50 which is what I want for good UVA/UVB protection & 98% coverage. The stick glides smootly on your face, no smell, no eye burn. The only thing is to give good waterproof stick to your face, it's not as soft as I like for my lips but did protect them. For me, who works at a pool on weekends~ This tiny pocket sized tube that survived heavy sweat for an hour is a keeperGreat for people like me who are sun sensitive BUT also are allergic to the typical chemical-based sunscreens like PABA. I break out in a bad rash from these ingredients but I can use zinc and titanitum based physical sunscreens. To date, I've been using baby sunscreen for that reason. This is a nice large tube, goes on clear when you rub it in and provides excellent sunscreen for outdoor sports like skiing and swimming.i get outside a lot. In the summer, hiking, and in the winter, skiing. Protecting my skin from the sun's UV rays is important, particularly at higher altitudes. This Coppertone sunscreen has the same active ingredients and in about the same percentages as other SPF 50 sprays that I have used, thus assuring its effectiveness. What is different is that the sunscreen emerges from the can as a cream much like whipped cream. This make it much easier to apply to my face, unlike liquid sunscreens, which are difficult to use. I like it.I love Coppertone products and it is always my choice for sun skin care. I grew up using Coppertone so it only makes sense to stay with what works. However, I do not like this "whipped" version of sunscreen. It doesn't spread as far as lotion and I think that the 5 oz container can be used up very quickly. Things I do like are the locking cap as I have a young grandson who is in to everything. I like the scent - somewhat light original Coppertone scent. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feel to the skin. What I think this container will be good for is maybe touching up facial area, but once you start spreading on limbs, you need a lot.Hey, it’s been around forever for a reason: it works and it works well. Take care of your skin. Skin cancer is not fun. Been there, done that.I like this lotion. It rubs on well with near-invisible lines, doesn't smell too sweet or fruity, and protects the skin from burn for a good 80 minutes. The tube is small enough to pack in a day pack while out hiking, and the lid stays on tightly. This does leave an oily sheen on the skin, which most sunblocks do anyway. Here in the desert, though, that oil attracts more dust that get clogged in the pores. It's the payoff for avoiding sunburn.When I was a kid, my mother used to swipe zinc oxide across my nose and cheeks since I was so susceptible to sunburn, and I used to hate the white marks across my face. Since then, companies have been more creative with zinc oxide by coloring it and, in Coppertone's case, creating a zinc formula that is less white and therefore less visible -- yes, LESS visible. When I apply it to my skin, which is fair but no longer pale white, I can see the line where I ended the application because the skin with the Defend & Care is decidedly paler, even once rubbed in. I can't tell that there's something on the skin as much as I can tell that the skin is a shade lighter than the rest. My skin remains a little greasy afterward, as though I've used a moisturizer that hasn't yet been fully absorbed. If you need protection from the sun and don't mind skin a shade lighter than usual, this is a good product. I'd rather use Coppertone's Sports sunblock on my face most days; however, if I'm going to be in the brutal sun, applying this over the sunscreen and on my nose, cheeks, and shoulders the way my mother used to do, will protect the areas of my body most likely to burn, even with sunscreen. As with other sunblocks, apply well before going out in the sun and throughout the day. -- Debbie Lee WesselmannThis is a decent mainstream sunscreen for your face. I like that it is zinc based, waterproof and clear. I use spf 50, but have burned my face because I go light around my eyes, nose and mouth when I have to use a regular sunscreen. This doesn't burn my eyes from sweat like Coppertone sport does, and I didn't have a feeling of dry tight skin by the end of the day. Check the ingredients before purchase if you have concerns.I don't particularly like the nozzle on this bottle mainly because I think it needs a cap for keeping in a beach bag, shipping, or just getting turned over/falling off counters, ect. They've made a top that turns a bit so that it has an on/off function. It's just plastic though. There's a "V" in the back that has to line up with a notich in order for it to be depressed. The top of mine got banged up a bit and it had popped out of the base, so it took me a while to get the can usable. It worked fine after I got it popped back in, but I noticed if the top of the sprayer gets hit against anything, it pops out easily. It does work ok though. It delivers a stream of airy mousse. The mousse looks like whipped cream but is thicker than hair mousse. It is easy to see as you rub it in, which can help with getting full coverage, but it does disappear quickly. It is sticky at first, but that only lasts a minute, then my skin just feels soft and well moisturized. I like the way it feels after a minute. It is waterproof too- it's easy to tell it is as water beads on my skin a bit after I apply it and runs off clear, like it doesn't take the product with it. It does not leave skin looking oily at all. It has several ingredients for good skin protection. This one is going in my car as I think it is perfect for my use when driving for my right arm, side of face, and neck. (I love to ride with my window rolled down but need sun protection to do so.) This has a light pleasant scent and is long lasting, with strong 50 spf, and goes on easily and absorbs completely, so I don't worry about it ruining my clothes or making me look oiled. It's quick and easy to put on. It's also easy to share, in case I have a rider who needs some protection too."""
